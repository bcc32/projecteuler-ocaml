* TODO one separate library for answer tests
So it's easier to run separately, and so we can test by shelling out
to euler, which means we can run in parallel.

Alternatively, figure out how to [[https://github.com/ocaml/dune/issues/1516][make dune run tests in parallel]].
* TODO ~Solution_intf.Arg.main~ should return a string
Might be easier to automate things if it returns a string instead of
printing.
* TODO Add ~unimplemented~ function
#+BEGIN_SRC ocaml
  let () = unimplemented [%here]
#+END_SRC
* TODO Add support for inline benchmarking
E.g., using ~ppx_bench~.  This might require build system support.
* TODO Benchmark solutions under flambda
